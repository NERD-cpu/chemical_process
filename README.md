Showcasing model examples of simple chemical process such as packed bed


Packed bed
----------
The program can determine: 
i) the length/height of the packed bed required to achieve the desired conversion X, or ii) determine the conversion given the length of the reactor.
The packed bed reactor is packed with solid catalysts and the reactions take place in the solid particles. 

It comprises computation of Thiele Modulus, internal effectiveness factor and overall effectiveness factor to simulate the reaction with internal diffusion limitation. Rate constant, external mass transfer coefficient, inlet reactant concentration and information about the solid catalysts are required in this program.

Please change the parameters at the top of the code.
