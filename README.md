Showcasing model examples of simple chemical process such as packed bed


Packed bed
----------
The program determines the length/height of the packed bed required to achieve the desired conversion X. The packed bed reactor is packed with solid catalysts and the reactions take place in the solid particles. 

It comprises computation of Thiele Modulus, internal effectiveness factor and overall effectiveness factor to simulate the reaction with internal diffusion limitation. Rate constant, external mass transfer coefficient, inlet reactant concentration and information about the solid catalysts are required in this program.
